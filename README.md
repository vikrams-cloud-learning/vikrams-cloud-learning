# 👋 About Me

Hello! I'm a Cloud Engineer who likes building reliable, scalable, and maintainable cloud solutions that drive business success. My journey in tech began with a feeling of FOMO during my Bachelor's, but it led me to discover my true passion for Cloud Computing ☁️ and DevOps ♾️.

🎓With a Master's in Applied Computer Science from Dalhousie University, I've developed a robust technical skill set 🧠 and hands-on experience through projects and certifications🎖️. 

I'm not just a typical tech guy who codes away 🧑‍💻; I actively explore how my work impacts business growth and efficiency 📈. My customer service background has equipped me with strong communication 🗣️ and collaboration skills 🤝, essential for any successful team.
